st.header(":orange[Inverse Kinematics]")

st.markdown("""Inverse kinematics in the IRB 120 involve determining the joint angles required to achieve a specific end-effector position and orientation. Due to its six degrees of freedom (DOF), solving inverse kinematics for the IRB 120 requires complex mathematical calculations. Using geometric and trigonometric principles, the robot's kinematic chain, comprising rotational joints and links, is analyzed to derive the joint angles corresponding to the desired end-effector pose. Advanced algorithms, such as iterative methods or closed-form solutions, are employed to compute these angles efficiently. Accurate inverse kinematics computation is crucial for precise robot motion control and task execution in various industrial applications.""")
